# ProxyProvider

A library that provides valid proxies (ip, port) suitable for crawling sites without getting banned from the site. 

Instead of searching for not banned or available ips and ports, this library crawls the site https://free-proxy-list.net/,
which provides free proxies, and gives you at any time the proxy that you need.

Also, you can download the library as a .jar file.
